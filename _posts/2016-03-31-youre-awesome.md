**WARNING: CHEESE ALERT! SO MUCH DELIGHTFUL CHEESE.**<br><br>Here's a little something I try to live by: "Don't forget where you started, and don't forget who helped you get to where you are today."<br><br>I'm proud of the work I've accomplished along side my teammates, and I MUST acknowledge them because it took various levels of effort on everyone's part. Thus, here's a shout out to all of the awesome people I've worked with thus far during my career. It's been a pleasure to learn and work with all of you!<br><br>
