![Dr. Cornel West at Sac State](/images/posts/education/cornel-west.jpg "Dr. Cornel West at Sac State")

Yesterday, I went to California State University, Sacramento (Sac State) to hear Dr. Cornel West's lecture called <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article105100541.html" target="_blank">"Race, Democracy, Justice, and Love"</a>. It was a free event with a huge turn out. I wasn't early enough to sit inside the auditorium, but it was enough for me to watch the projected live stream in solidarity with 1000+ people on the outside lawn. On [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornel_West), it says he is an "American philosopher, academic, social activist, author, public intellectual, and prominent member of the Democratic Socialists of America"; and big bonus: he "grew up in Sacramento, CA." (Shout out to the Sacramento Proud, 916 born and/or raised.)

Naturally this event hit me with pride and a hint of college lecture nostalgia... so here I am reflecting on my education journey.

### Past

I experimented with several classes at multiple community colleges; my major remained in limbo for awhile, but I eventually stumbled, took a chance, and made a choice. By my second year, I went from graphic design to sociology to psychology to economics to accounting. (All things that still interest me, but maybe in another universe I can afford a diploma in them all.) I discovered a class called "Algorithm Design and Implementation", a prerequisite class for accounting. As far as my happily ever after story goes, it turned out computer science was my thing. (My boo thang. BAE.) I put a ring on it, and finally declared my major as computer science. After three years, I completed general education at Sacramento City College (Sac City) and the lower division computer science classes at American River College (ARC); then I transferred to the University of California, Davis (UC Davis). I finished the upper division requirements for a computer science major and a computational biology minor. After five years, my college career and student occupation ended.

### Present

*Here on my freshly Swiffer-ed floor lies the following:*<br>

- framed bachelor of science diploma from the University of California, Davis
- textbook for ECS122A: Algorithm Design and Analysis
- textbook for BIS132: Introduction to Dynamic Models in Biology
- textbook for FST 3: Introduction to Beer and Brewing
- folder from UC Davis Computer Science Department
- name badge from UC Davis transfer orientation
- checklist for UC Davis Computer Science Major 2011-2012
- recipient letter for American River College scholarships
- recipient letter for Sacramento City College scholarships

This image literally contains a pile of wood/paper based items stacked on top of each other. (Let’s take a moment to say thanks to the trees that were sacrificed for my education. Thanks, trees!) Symbolically this image represents my college education. More so it can be interpreted as experience, commitment, opportunity, foundation, intellect, prestige, privilege, scattered journey, "started from the bottom now we here", etc. No matter what it is, I am honored to own it and I am proud to check it off my bucket list.

*Important gotcha in the photo:*<br>Although community college played the most "heroic" role in my college education story, it's covered up by the fact that I didn't go for an Associate's degree and my transfer units GPA was wiped out at UC Davis. (Essentially, community college is the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. AKA Batman.) HOWEVER, the six scholarships I was awarded from Sac City and ARC "transferred over" with me in my bank account. (Shout out to financial aid for holding it down and funding my brain cells.)

### Future

Anyway, my college years are long gone, but as many people have said before me,**“You are forever a student.”** Or even better last night, Dr. Cornel West more eloquently said, "We're here to learn how to die. The only way to live is to learn how to die." While speaking to the university audience, he said, "Raise the question, 'did I allow a college to go through me in such a way that I learned how to die and therefore I emerge with more power, more insight, more courage, not just capacity to make money, but the money that I make will be used for my family, and self, and also be a citizen committed in public interest?"

(Thoughts out. Drop the mic.)
