# lshig.github.io

Check out the [Live Demo](https://lshig.github.io)!

A way for me to introduce myself and play with Atom, GitHub Pages, Jekyll, Materialize, Font Awesome, and SASS.

## Basics

- Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Install [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) configured to an editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- Clone or fork the repository `https://github.com/lshig/lshig.github.io.git`
- In the terminal: `cd lshig.github.io`
- Build and compile: `jekyll serve`
- View by opening `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in a web browser

## TODO
- add Modernizr or alternative
- consider new navbar options, based on mobile browser status bars
- responsive flex design and white space gap on iPad from status bars
- improve text and writing
- add animations, parallax images, button hovers, page scrolling, page transitions?
- make page and writing more accessible
- GitHub API!
- Inspect Element easter eggs
- build more projects!

Thanks for stopping by to see the things I like to experiment on!

Cheers,<br>
