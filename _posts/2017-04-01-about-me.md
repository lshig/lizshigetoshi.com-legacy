- I love tinkering and translating my ideas to code! I want to build applications that are innovative, meaningful, and fun to use.
- I graduated from the University of California, Davis with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Computational Biology. Go Aggies!
- I'm 916 born-n-raised, and a born again supporter of the Sacramento Kings. (Though I have a special place for all of my favorite NBA point guards.)
- I was bit by my first wanderlust bug in 2013. Since then, I've traveled to 16 U.S. states and 13 countries. There's many more places on my bucket list!
- I'm an avid user of emojis, memes, and the word *y'all*.
