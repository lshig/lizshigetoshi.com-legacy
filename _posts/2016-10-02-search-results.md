I've been exchanging data with the interwebs since 5th grade, 1998. I'm a millennial and it definitely shows.

<a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/pages/millennials/index.html" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs Millennial Infographic</a> describes millennials as "the first digital natives... [They] have grown up with the internet and smartphones in an always-on digital world."

### A Blessing and A Curse

Since my 2016 Southeast Asia trip, I seriously evaluated my identity and how I brand myself. As far as Google search engine and I know, I'm the only "Elizabeth Aya Shigetoshi" out there, thus potentially the only "Liz Shigetoshi" out there. Truly a blessing and a curse.

I clicked through 15 Gooooooooooooooogle pages, which contained a whopping 145 relevant results. Nobody's perfect, but everything seemed to return back low-key and chill. Part of me was tickled and relieved; another part of my soul screamed, "DEAR GAWD, THAT'S ANCIENT!" Overall-- no regrets.

### Closure

I'm lightweight praying trolls don't come along to clobber inconvenience all over my current Google search results, but let's be real and keep it 100, the Internet is a crazy place. Things happen. Some things I control, others not so much. I'm here for a finite amount of time, but while I'm here I can own my name and clarify whatever may need it.

Anyway, I close this thought by encouraging everyone to actively evaluate self, identity, branding, and Internet presence. It was a whirlwind of effort and feelings, but if I didn't do it, then who else will?
