- I love tinkering with new technologies and translating my ideas to code! I want to build applications that are innovative, meaningful, and fun to use.
- I graduated from the University of California, Davis with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Computational Biology. Go Aggies!
- Iâ€™m heavily fueled by a daily dose of 150+ mg of caffeine and 150+ g of carbs drenched in hot sauce. NOMS!
- Since November 2014, I got my health in check and lost 30lb... so being a sweaty gym junky is kinda my thing now too.
- I'm 916 born-n-raised, and a born again supporter of the Sacramento Kings. (Though I have a special place for all of my favorite NBA point guards.)
- I was bit by my first wanderlust bug in 2013, and plan to explore many more places on my bucket list!
